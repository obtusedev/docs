# Documentation

## Purpose

This repo is a collection of what I think is the best and worst looking documentation.

Good documentation can save you lots of time and frustration and can help generate interest in your tool. When I say good documentation I'm not just referring to how it looks but how easy it is to find what I'm looking for. There are good documentation that are simple in style, like request python lib, and there are stylish documentation like FastAPI framework for python. 

Easy to find information > Good theme

> Information here refers to but is not limited to tool setup (installation, updating, deleting), API ref (how to use a class, function/method, parameters), code examples, tutorial/quickstart (how to use your tool)


Good documentation:

  * Easy to navigate
  * Lots of examples
  * Up to date
  * Good for new and current users
  * Has resources for learning the tool
  * Clear sections
  * Uniformity i.e standard code style(e.g JS code examples with and without ;)
    * There are tools that are more opinionated than others, think Django vs Flask, and there maybe many ways to do something. In that case it should show the multiple options with pros/cons and let the user decide.

  Nice to have but not required:

  * Download offline with multiple formats (epub, pdf, html)
  * Easy to request an edit (for typos and suggestions) e.g. PR on Github
  * Button to copy code snippet
  * Running code snippet on the site
  * Clean readable font
  * Good SEO (Your official docs should ideally be the first google result over third party results)
  (nothing worse than seeing W3, Geek4Geeks ranking over MDN)
  * Good use of whitespace aka information not too jam packed
  * Good size font where you don't have to squint [cppr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
  * Search feature built in
  * Code styles
  * Best practices
  * Code examples for common usecases/problems

Bad documentation on the other hand waste time for users when they go to Stackoverflow/Google rather than the documentations. It can also frustrate users to the point of abandoning learning and/or using your tool. I know I've done this when I've given up on using and/or learning a tool because the docs were crap.

Bad Documentation:

  * Bad SEO (Has bad third party resources over the official docs)
  * No built in search feature (Having the resort to site:thedocs.com) 
  * No/Little/Bad/Outdated examples
  * Ambiguous and/or convoluted install instructions
  * No getting started guide
  * Lacking uniformity (Like the docs were written by many different people with varying opinions and code styles)

## Best

### Languages

Rust: [Rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/)  

Really nice documentation especially when compared to something like C++.  
You can use [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/book) to make your own documentation look as good as the Rust docs

  * Appealing theme
  * Lots of examples
  * Easy to navigate and use 
  * Clear sections for std lib, book, course, etc
  * [md-book](https://github.com/rust-lang/book)
  * Free book to learn rust
  * Free rust course
  * Good for first timers and professionals alike


JavaScript: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)  

One of the best documentation. Gold standard IMO for JS  

  * Clean and concise
  * Easy to navigate and use
  * Clear sections for tutorial, language ref, APIs
  * Lots of examples
  * Has lots of docs for tutorials, references(lang & apis), tools
  * Good for first timers and professionals alike
